Farm Combat Grants XP Too
==========================

In vanilla, when you kill a monster on the farm, you get no XP from it. This mod makes it so you do.

**NOTE: THE XP NUMBERS ARE FROM [UI INFO SUITE 2](https://github.com/Annosz/UIInfoSuite2/releases). THIS MOD DOES NOT ADD XP NUMBERS, IT JUST RESTORES THE ABILITY TO GET XP ON THE FARM.

### Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

### Config options

* `GainExp` restores XP gain from monster kills on farm.

* `SpecialOrderCompletion` counts monster kills on farm towards special order objectives.
