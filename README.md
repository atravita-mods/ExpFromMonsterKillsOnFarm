Farm Combat Grant XP Too
==========================

In vanilla, when you kill a monster on the farm, you get no XP from it. This mod makes it so you do.

**NOTE: THE XP NUMBERS ARE FROM [UI INFO SUITE 2](https://github.com/Annosz/UIInfoSuite2/releases). THIS MOD DOES NOT ADD XP NUMBERS, IT JUST RESTORES THE ABILITY TO GET XP ON THE FARM.[/size][/b]
